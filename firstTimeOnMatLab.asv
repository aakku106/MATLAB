% this is comment in matlab, i will say its preety much wired ðŸ˜‚
x=5; % this means x is double type having value 5
% we can preety much use it like C 
% ; supresses the output

y=5;
z=x+y; % supress the output

z % shows the output in command windows 

clc % this means to clear command window[preetymuch like a terminal in C]
% at glance matlab seems like a inteprator to me 
% clearvar means to clear the values in variables

% matlav actually means Matrix laboratory,
% lest look at some matrix stuffs

A=[1,3;4,6] % it 2x2 matrix A, having 1 & 3 in row 1 and 4&6 in row 2
clc;
disp(A) % this is another way of displaying stuff, rather say a proper way
c=size(A);
disp(c);

function wee=adition(a,b)
    wee=a+b;
end

disp(adition(1,1)
